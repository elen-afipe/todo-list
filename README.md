[Organize your projects with ToDo Code](https://elen-afipe.github.io/todo-list/)

When I started the project of The Odin Project curriculum, I didn’t know how to organize it and which features should be implemented as I rarely use task managers. I started thinking how to organize my code and follow best practices. After a while I realized that breaking a project into smaller parts can help me break the loop of "where to start", that’s how an idea of ToDo Code came to mind.
